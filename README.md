# Algorithm Engineering â€“ Sequoia Tree Adaptive Structure

**Duration:** Mar 2023

## Overview
Built a dynamically balancing binary tree with tallness constraints, recursive height updates, and intelligent left/right rotation logic triggered on insertion.

## Features
- Designed custom fix-balance mechanics and overrideable height evaluation to maintain efficient lookup times under worst-case insert/remove conditions.
- Implemented full search, insert, and delete operations with parent-pointer tracking and recursive re-rooting to ensure structural integrity at all times.

## Technologies & Skills Applied
C++, data structures, tree balancing, recursive algorithms, custom search logic

## Setup Instructions
1. Compile using g++ or compatible compiler
2. Run test cases using `make test` or direct CLI input
